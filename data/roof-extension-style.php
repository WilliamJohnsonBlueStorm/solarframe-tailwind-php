They provide a cosy, yet bright space and are a world away from a conservatory. Not forgetting you can also add in bifold, sliding patio or French doors, you can truly make your extension into your own design to suit your needs.'],

They\'re often placed into lean-to extensions, where there\'s a long expanse of tiled roof but you can place them in any style of roof. You can have as few or as many as you like. '],

Similar to an orangery roof in style, the lantern is placed into the solid, tiled roof and creates a statement. The benefits being you still get most of the thermal efficiency, with the addition of natural light. A great option for kitchen/dining extensions.'],
